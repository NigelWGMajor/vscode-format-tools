|as| alt + shift|          alt|        more complex changes, some undos
|ac |alt + ctrl|             organizing| marking, cycling and moving

### Exchange

`cs X`   to-Swap     Is context driven:

|Context| Effect|

- Ref, Warn and User symbols can be used anywhere in a line for emphasis or clarification 
- Numbers can be inserted anywhere, usiually for traige or organization
- Link symbols insert templates for file, heading or url links
