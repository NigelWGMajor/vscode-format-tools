## Features

This is a text editor extension providing enhanced text editing. Multiple selections are usually accepted: where noted, defaults will be applied when there is no selection: w: defaults to current word l: defaults to current line 

Suggested keybindings:

|---|--------------|------------|----------------------------------|
|cs | ctrl + shift |      common|most simple formatting changes    |
|as | alt  + shift |      alt   |more complex changes, some undos  |

## caser Properties

**dimmableMatches** defines whether to dim lines matching tag definitions in the current language. This is used by the `to-Dimmed` command. This is an array of strings: each string starts with the target language id (e.g. `markdown` or `sql`) followed by one or more regex expressions, all seperated with colons. For example, to dim lines with `<pre` or `pre>` tags in markdown, you would set the property to: `markdown:<pre:pre>`. To dim lines with `--` in SQL, you would set the property to: `sql:--`. Only one string per language, but multiple regex expressions are supported.

**regexPatterns** lists useful regex patterns for use by the `Select by Regex` function.

**dotIcons, squareIcons, numberIcons, stepIcons, queryIcons, refIcons, warnIcons, linkIcons, userIcons**

These define the symbols or icons to be used by the various marking functions.

### Exchange

`cs X`   to-Swap     Is context driven:

|Context| Effect|
|--|--|
Cursor between words, no selection| Exchanges the surrounding words if on the same line
Selected word(s)| Exchanges the word before and the word after
In a word, no selection| Exchanges the letters before and after the cursor
In a word, letters selected| Exchanges the start of the word and the end, eaving the selected portion intact

### Dummy text

`as L`  LoremIpsum

### Encryption

`cs ?`   to-Flip  (uses local environment variable VSCODE_KEY as seed) 
- Switches bwteen encrypted and clear

### Organization and marking (Markdown only!)

The symbol sets can be edited in the settings.json file. When a symbol is placed, subsequent uses of the same key will cycle through the symbols in that set. 

- Query, Line and Step marking is typically used to show status of lines and will step over indents.
- Ref, Warn and User symbols can be used anywhere in a line for emphasis or clarification 
- Numbers can be inserted anywhere, usiually for traige or organization
- Link symbols insert templates for file, heading or url links

`ac P` to-End      pushes content to end. If starts with a header, that is moved and a link inserted.
  
`ac F` to-File      Top line must have file link [a](./filename.md) (this remains)

- the rest moves to that file, link remains. 
- Repeat to append to file. File is opened and updated.

`acs enter` to Terminal - pushes the one line at a time to the shell.
- is wrapped in `cmd /k` and `exit`
- all forward slashes are converted to backslashes.
- surrounding backticks are removed
